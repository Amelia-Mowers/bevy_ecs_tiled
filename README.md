# bevy_ecs_tiled

Plugin for working with 2D tilemaps created with the Tiled map editor

## Status

** **EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT USE** **

This crate is currently in a very early state while I build the basics.
I'm still new to Bevy so this is a learning exercise. Feel free to
contribute. Eventually I'd like to provide solid and easy-to-use
support for the Tiled map editor so that I can use it in my own
game projects.
